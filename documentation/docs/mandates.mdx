Mandates represent an authorization to initiate payments from an account. The
mandate describes the amount that can be paid, the regularity of the payments
and and expiry for the mandate.

The mandate DOES NOT describe who is able to initiate the payments this is
managed by an authorization server.

In order to initiate a payment out of an account a client must create a
[charge](./charges) sub-resource under the mandate and MUST have the necessary
authorization to do so.

The Open Payments server MUST only create the charge if the requested payment
fits within the bounds of the mandate and the requesting client is authorized to
create charges.

    * Acceptance
    * status
    * Multiuse? Not sure if this is needed but could be nice

### Payments

A mandate defines the total value of all payments that can be made in a single
interval, the duration of an interval, and the start and end time for the
mandate.

If a mandate has no interval duration defined then the start and end times
define the duration of the interval.

If an interval duration is defined then intervals start from the start time of
the mandate and repeat as defined by the interval until the end time of the
mandate.

For example the following mandate allows a charge of USD 5 every month for a
year, starting on 1 January 2020:

- amount: 500
- asset code: USD
- asset scale: 2
- start at: 1 January 2020 00:00:00.000
- expires at: 31 December 2020 23:59:59.999
- interval: P1M

Interval durations are defined using
[ISO 8601 durations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations).

If the interval duration exceeds the interval defined by the start and end date
and times then the interval is the time between the start and end date times.

## Resource Representation

The `application/json` representation of a mandate resource provides the details
of the mandate as a JSON document.

| Property   | Type         | Description                                                                                    |

| account    | URL          | The URL identifying the **account** from which the mandate allows payments                     |

| assetScale | int32        | The asset scale of the mandate                                                                 |
| startAt    | DateTime     | The date and time after which intervals begin being calculated                                 |

| interval   | ISO Duration | The duration of an interval                                                                    |
| balance    | int64        | The total value of all **charges** that can be made under this mandate in the current interval |

## APIs

The mandates API endpoint is relative to the account that is being paid from
using the sub-resource URL: **`./mandates`**

Specifically, the URL of the mandates API endpoint is the result of performing
the URL parsing algorithm in
[WHATWG URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-parsing) where:

- _input_ is `./mandates`, and
- _base_ is the account URL

For example, for the account URL `https://wallet.example/alice` the mandates API
endpoint for that account is `https://wallet.example/alice/mandates`

### Create

A client creates a mandate by doing an HTTP POST of a JSON document to the
mandates API endpoint.

The JSON document MUST include the following:

- amount
- assetCode
- assetScale

and MAY include the following:

- startAt
- expiresAt
- interval

The Open Payments server MUST respond with a `201 Created` response or an error
(TDB). The response MUST contain the newly created mandate and a `Location`
response header with the URL of the newly created invoice.

The following is a non-normative example where the client creates a mandate at
the account identified by `$wallet.example/bob`

```http
POST /bob/mandates HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode" : "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "interval": "P1M",
}
```

with a non-normative response from the Open Payments Server

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://wallet.example/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6
{
  "id": "https://wallet.example/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6",
  "account": "https://wallet.example/bob",
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode" : "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "interval": "P1M",
  "startAt": "2020-01-22T00:00:00Z",
  "balance": 200
}
```

### Get

The client reads the mandate by doing an HTTP GET of the corresponding mandate
URL. The Open Payments server MUST respond with either a mandate or an error
(TBD)

The following is a non-normative example where the client reads a mandate that
allows charges amounting to USD 2 per month and USD 1.34 is still available to
be charged in the current month.

```http
GET /mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6 HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi...
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "https://wallet.example/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6",
  "account": "https://wallet.example/bob",
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode" : "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "interval": "P1M",
  "startAt": "2020-01-22T00:00:00Z",
  "balance": 134
}
```

### Charges

Wallets MUST implement the charges API for mandates. This is defined in the
[Charges section](charges)

## Management of Mandates

It is recommended wallets provide users with the ability to manage their
mandates. Users should be able to view the state of mandates created against
their accounts and the authorizations that have been created to make charges
against them.

Users should be able to revoke a mandate at any time.

## Lifecyle

> **TODO**: Clients that create mandates should have the ability to register a
> callback to be notified of changes to the state of the mandate such as
> cancellation by the user.
