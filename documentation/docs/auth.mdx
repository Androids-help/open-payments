title: Authentication
---

Authentication is an important concept in Open Payments. It follows the principle of providing Strong Customer
Authentication for Users whenever transactions are performed. This improves on the current
scenario with credit-cards where stolen credit card details can lead to unsolicited payments on behalf of the User
. Open Payments has chosen to build the Authentication on top of OAuth2 due to its ubiquitous use in the web currently.

However, OAuth2 currently does not support fine grained access to resources. Work is currently being done to provide for
fine-grained authentication through 
[Rich Authorization Requests](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lodderstedt-oauth-rar-03) (RAR). This allows
Clients to specify a fine-grained access to a singular Invoice, Mandate or Charge using a JSON structure. Further
, OAuth2 is a front-channel based authorization framework. This has made it difficult to innovate and provide secure
communication channels between Clients and Authentication Servers. Further work is being performed in the form of
TXAuth to improve on OAuth2. With this in mind, Open Payments uses RAR whilst actively participating in the
TXAuth spec to look at using a more modern standard for authentication.


## Authorization Details for RAR

In order to ensure interoperability between Client and Authentication Server (AS) for authorization, it is necessary
to define a set structure for the `authorization_details` passed into . 

Mandate
Access: "read", "charge"
```json
{
  "openPayments": {
         "mandate":{
            "name":"//issuer.wallet/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6",
            "access": [ "read", "charge" ]
         }
      }
}
```
