The following use case demonstrates a PUSH based retail payment example between two parties, the merchant and
a customer. The flow is based off the merchant creating an invoice on its own wallet, which is then presented to the customer. 
The customer can then present this invoice to its own wallet to complete the payment.

# Flow

Based on the diagram above the flow is as follows:
1. Merchant creates an invoice at its Acquirer for the amount that it would like the customer to pay
2. Merchant presents the invoice/url to the customer.
3. The customer submits the invoice to its Issuer (own wallet) to pay the invoice
4. Merchant checks for payment of invoice

## 1. Creating Invoice at Acquirer

Below is a non-normative example of a merchant with a Payment Pointer of `$aquirer.wallet/merchant` creating an invoice at its Acquirer.
The merchant creates the invoice by making a POST request to the `/merchant/invoices` path
with an Invoice included as a JSON payload:

```http
POST /merchant/invoices HTTP/1.1
Host: acquirer.wallet
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "subject": "$acquirer.wallet/merchant",
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "amount": 200
}
```

A successful `201` response will return an invoice object. Below is a non-normative example of a successful response to 
the creation of an invoice for `$aquirer.wallet/merchant`.

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://acquirer.wallet/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e

{
  "name": "//acquirer.wallet/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e",
  "subject": "$acquirer.wallet/merchant",
  "amount": 200
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "received": 0
}
```

## 2. Present invoice to customer

Once the merchant has the invoice, it would present the invoice to the customer. This could be in the form of a URL or
QRCode, or the merchant application could redirect the sender to the sender's wallet to pay the invoice. 
This flow should be left to individual merchants to implement.

## 3. Customer submits invoice to Issuer

The customer can now submit the invoice to its Issuer. If its a URL it could paste it into some dialog or if its a QRCode,
they could scan with their native app. It is expected that the Issuer would ask confirmation before executing an Invoice payment.

### Payment

To complete the payment the Issuer would need to get payment details from the invoice. By doing a GET against
the invoice with the `Accept` header set to `application/connection+json`, the sender can get the 
payment details necessary to pay the invoice. In this example, the sender and receiver wish to transact over Interledger, 
so the Acquirer would respond with a `destination_address` and `shared_secret`.

The following is a non-normative example of an Issuer getting ILP payment details for an Invoice from the Acquirer.

```http
GET /invoices/2d24bd87-1afc-465e-a4ec-07cb4f70f7b0 HTTP/1.1
Host: acquirer.wallet
Accept: application/connection+json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "destination_address": "g.aquirer.42e0f0c9284ad401b7c941bc6173f4e",
  "shared_secret": "AvLaEGc+ojGHVezQF9DC4/7F5YIvrNPx/VM+4hJkCbs=",
}
```

The Issuer would now use the payment details to perform the payment over Interledger using STREAM. 

As payments are fulfilled, the `received` amount on the invoice would increase to reflect the payments.

## 4. Check payment

The merchant would validate the payment of the invoice with the Acquirer. This could be achieved through polling against the invoice
or the Acquirer could provide convenience webhooks for the merchant to get notified of successful payments. This is left up to Wallets to
decide to implement.
