At the heart of all interactions in Open Payments is an [account](./accounts).
The account could be either the sending or the receiving side of the
transaction. The entity initiating the transaction is the Open Payments
[client](./terminology#client) and discovers the account at the Open Payments
[server](./terminology#server).

In the following example of a [person-to-person payment](./p2p) from Alice to
Bob, Alice's wallet is the client and therefore her wallet discovers Bob's
account at his wallet to begin the transaction.

<PersonToPerson />

However, in the second example Alice is the payee but her wallet still uses
Bob's Payment Pointer to discover his account and create and authorize a mandate
to pull funds from it.

<RequestToPay />

Discovery starts with an identifier, which in Open Payments is an account
identifier called a **Payment Pointer**.

## Payment Pointers

In keeping with the [REST](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-2)
pattern, all entities in Open Payments are **resources** identified by, and
addressable via, URLs. This includes [accounts](./accounts) which are the root
resource in Open Payments. Discovery involves finding the URL of the account
resource because all other resource URLs are relative to the account.

> Example account URL:  
> `https://wallet.example/accounts/dee69df8-be40-478f-9828-6267f4d42b01`

To make account URLs shorter and easier to transcribe they can be encoded as a
**[Payment Pointer](https://paymentpointers.org)**. In this form they also have
the advantage of being easily and unambiguously recognizable as Payment
Pointers.

> Example Payment Pointer:  
> `$wallet.example/accounts/dee69df8-be40-478f-9828-6267f4d42b01`

[Wallets](./terminology#wallet) that support Open Payments will define one or
more unique account URLs for each account they service on behalf of the account
owner.

<Mermaid
  chart={`erDiagram
  OWNER ||--|{ ACCOUNT : has
  ACCOUNT-URL }|--|| ACCOUNT : "identified by"
  ACCOUNT-URL ||--|| PAYMENT-POINTER : "encoded as"
`}
/>

The rules for encoding and decoding Payment Pointers are defined at
[paymentpointers.org](https://paymentpointers.org).

### Personal Payment Pointers

In many cases a user will have multiple accounts and will register a single
short and easy to transcribe **Personal Payment Pointer** which they link to
their default account. This Personal Payment Pointer can then be easily
exchanged with counter-parties when initiating a payment (either as sender or
receiver).

> Example Personal Payment Pointer:  
> `$wallet.example/alice`

## PayID

Another form of identifier that can be used by account owners is a PayID. A
PayID identifies the account owner and not an individual account so it is
possible for a client, given a PayID to discover multiple accounts they can
transact with.

These accounts may have different currencies and may have additional options
for making incoming payments.

Discovery of accounts on an Open Payments server using a PayID is described in
the [Open Payments PayID discovery protocol](./payid).

### PayID vs Personal Payment Pointer

While at first glance these may appear to be the same, they are intentionally
different.

A **Personal Payment Pointer** MUST point to an account that supports
Interledger. A client that begins an Open Payments discovery algorithm with a
Payment Pointer is guaranteed to discover an account that supports incoming
payments via ILP.

In contrast a PayID requires a more indirect discovery flow (via the account
owner resource) it MAY be used to discover accounts connected to other payment
networks or accounts denominated in different currencies.

Both PayIDs and Personal Payment Pointers are analogous to an email address or
payment card number. Email addresses are given to counter-parties so that they
can begin sending emails to the target inbox. Similarly, a payment card number
can be given to a counter-party so that they can request payment from the target
account.

Users can share their PayID or Payment Pointers to both **get paid** and **make
payments** using Open Payments.

Importantly, neither a PayID nor a Payment Pointer is sensitive in the same way
that a payment card number is. They can be shared freely with no risk that funds
will be pulled from the discovered account without the account owner's consent

## Account Metadata

Account metadata is provided by an Open Payments Server as a JSON document that
describes the various service endpoints that are available to:

- make payments directly to the account via Interledger (or other payment
  methods)
- get authorization to perform actions on the account (using OAuth 2.0)
- get more information about the owner of the account (using OpenID Connect)
- create invoices and mandates that are linked to the account

The document is hosted at the account URL and is the default representation of
the account resource (using the media type of `application/json`).

The account URL is the root of further interactions with the account as all
other APIs are relative to the account URL.

See the [accounts API](./accounts) for more details.
