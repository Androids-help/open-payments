title: Identity

Open Payments does not yet have a well defined architecture around identity.

Our expectation is that this will expand upon the existing auth framework using
OAuth2 and therefore use identity frameworks like Open ID Connect or similar.

Regulatory requirements will likely drive this design along with implementation
experience.

Options:

- Federated
- Have a central registry similar to Open Banking Directory
