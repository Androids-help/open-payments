Open Payments is a standard for interactions between **wallets** (well actually
any [account servicer](./terminology#account-servicer) like a bank, a PSP,
mobile money provider etc. but we just say wallets to keep things simple). Open
Payments is used between the wallets to setup and authorize payments for a
variety of common [use cases](./p2p).

Open Payments builds on web technologies to define ways for a wallet to:

- [discover](./discovery) the API endpoints at another wallet, using an
  identifier for an account or account owner at that wallet
- use the [APIs](./api) to setup a payment between the two wallets
- exchange information with the other wallet that is required to complete the
  payment (business terms, regulatory info etc.)
- get [authorization](./auth) from the
  [account owners](./terminology#account-owner) (as required) to complete the
  payment
- setup and authorize [future payments](./mandates)

## The Interledger Protocol Stack

Open Payments is designed as an application level protocol built on top of the
[Interledger](./interledger) protocol. It _could_ be used over other payment
clearing systems but the assumption is that accounts [discovered](./discovery)
via Open payments support Interledger for making the payment itself.

## Roles

<FourCorner />

Often referred to as the four-corner model, the primary roles in most retail
payment scenarios are the Customer (Sender), Merchant (Receiver), Acquirer
(services the account of the merchant) and the Issuer (services the account of
the customer). The four-corner model is very card-centric but still provides a
good framework from which to define the roles in the various Open Payments
scenarios.

Borrowing standard terminology from the ISO20022 data-model we refer to the
issuer and acquirer as [account servicers](./terminology#account-servicer) and
the merchant and customer as [account owners](./terminology#account-owner).

Examples of an account servicer is a bank, a digital wallet or a mobile money
provider. The account servicer will run
[Open Payments Clients](./terminology#client) for initiating an Open Payments
interaction and [Open Payments Servers](./terminology#server) to accept incoming
requests from clients.

For brevity we simply call account servicers ["wallets"](./terminology#wallet),
but always keeping in mind that this extends beyond the traditional definition
of a "digital wallet" as a consumer product/service.
