Currencies are represented as `assetCode` and `assetScale` properties in Open
Payments and it is important to understand the relationship between the currency
of an account, and invoices and mandates on that account.

## Asset Code

Asset Codes are simply a code representing an asset or currency that is being
used as the unit of account for payments made with Open Payments. Any API or
resource which has an amount or balance will also have an asset code.

Asset Codes will usually be ISO 8768 currency codes but are not limited to
these.

## Asset Scale

The asset scale defines the scale of any amount or balance relative to the
natural scale of the asset. It is an integer value that expresses the scale in
powers of ten.

Any integer amount in an Open Payments API request/response can be converted to
the natural scale of the given asset by dividing the value by 10 to the power of
the asset scale.

For example, given the amount `1234`, the asset code `USD`, and the asset scale
`2`, the scaled amount is `$12.34` (i.e. `1234 / 10^2`).

## Invoice Currency

An invoice MUST always inherit the currency of the underlying account it is
created against. The [invoice API](./invoices) does not allow the asset code and
scale to be specified when creating a new invoice, however these are returned as
part of the invoice resource to avoid needing to query the account to get these
details.

## Mandate Currency

Mandates are created with an asset code and scale chosen by the client. This MAY
be different to the currency of the underlying account the mandate is created
against.

When a wallet requests an account owner to authorize a mandate the wallet MUST
display the terms of the mandate in both the currency of the mandate AND the
currency of the underlying account.

Since mandates may exist and be charged for long periods of time, it is likely
that the value of a charge, measured in the local account currency, will change.
Wallets SHOULD allow account owners to define a maximum bound for the mandate in
the account's local currency. This is internal to the wallet system and only
evaluated by the wallet when paying new charges submitted against the mandate.

For example, Alice creates a mandate against Bob's account for USD 100 which she
can charge weekly. But the currency of Bob's account is Bitcoin (BTC).

When Bob's wallet presents the details of the mandate to Bob to authorize, it
SHOULD do the following:

- Display the mandate amount in USD.
- Display the mandate terms in easy to understand language.
- Display the mandate amount at the current rate of exchange as estimated by
  Bob's wallet (e.g. 1 BTC = USD 10 000)
- Allow Bob to limit the amount that will be charged to his account per period
  (e.g. 0.011 BTC)

This might look as follows:

> Do you authorize Alice to charge your account USD 100 each calendar week?
>
> At current rates of exchange this is equivalent to 0.01 BTC. Alice will not be
> able to charge more than 0.011 BTC and will require a new mandate if the
> exchange rate changes by more than 10% from today's rate.
