The following use case demonstrates a merchant being able to charge customers at
a regular interval.

A merchant creates and authorizes a mandate for its customer at the customer's
wallet. The mandate is a form of delegated access authorized by the customer
which contains details about the interval, frequency, amount and start and end
dates. The merchant can then submit charges against the mandate to instruct the
customer's to perform payments.

# Flow

Based on the diagram above the flow is as follows:

1. Customer would provide their payment identifier (eg. Payment Pointer) to the
   Merchant
2. Merchant creates a mandate at the customer's wallet
3. Merchant requests authorization for the mandate from the wallet. The wallet
   takes the customer through a consent flow
4. The merchant can now submit invoices against the mandate for payments it
   wants to execute.

## 1. Providing Payment Identifier to Merchant

To initiate a recurring payment, the sender must give their Payment Pointer to
the merchant. The merchant can then use Open Payments discovery to resolve the
[mandates API](./mandates) at the customer's wallet.

## 2. Create mandate at the customer's wallet

In this example, the sender provided the Payment Pointer `$wallet.example/alice`
to the Merchant in the previous step. The Merchant then creates a mandate at the
customer's wallet by making a POST request to the [mandates API](./mandates).

```http
POST /alice/mandates HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "interval": "P1M"
}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "https://wallet.example/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6",
  "account": "https://wallet.example/alice",
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "interval": "P1M",
  "startAt": "2020-01-22T00:00:00Z",
  "subject": "$issuer.wallet/alice",
  "balance": 200
}
```

## 3. Merchant requests authorization for mandate

The merchant requests authorization to create charges against the newly created
mandate per the [authorization](./auth) flow.

This results in the merchant getting an `access_token` with which to use against
the mandate.

## 4. Merchant spends against mandate

The merchant can now submit charges against the mandate for goods/services
rendered. The merchant can do this as often as necessary, as long as the overall
spends don't exceed the limit of the current mandate interval.

### Create invoice

When the Merchant wants to PUSH money to itself from the mandate, it will first
create an invoice at its own wallet.

```http
POST /merchant/invoices HTTP/1.1
Host: otherwallet.example
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 100
}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://otherwallet.example/invoices/2d24bd87-1afc-465e-a4ec-07cb4f70f7b0

{
  "id": "https://otherwallet.example/invoices/2d24bd87-1afc-465e-a4ec-07cb4f70f7b0",
  "account" : "https://otherwallet.example/merchant"
  "amount": 100,
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "received": 0
}
```

### Submit invoice as a charge against the mandate

Using the created invoice it will submit a charge against the mandate using the
invoice URL

```http
POST /mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6/charges HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.wallet
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "invoice": "https://otherwallet.example/invoices/2d24bd87-1afc-465e-a4ec-07cb4f70f7b0"
}

```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```

This will instruct the customer's wallet to perform a payment of the invoice
within the scope of the given mandate.

### Payment

To complete the payment the customer's wallet would need to get payment details
from the invoice. By doing a GET against the invoice with the `Accept` header
set to `application/ilp-stream+json`, the sender can get the payment details
necessary to pay the invoice. In this example, the sender and receiver wish to
transact over Interledger, so the Acquirer would respond with a `ilpAddress` and
`sharedSecret`.

The following is a non-normative example of the wallet getting ILP payment
details for an invoice from the other wallet.

```http
GET /invoices/2d24bd87-1afc-465e-a4ec-07cb4f70f7b0 HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Accept: application/ilp-stream+json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "ilpAddress": "g.aquirer.42e0f0c9284ad401b7c941bc6173f4e",
  "sharedSecret": "AvLaEGc+ojGHVezQF9DC4/7F5YIvrNPx/VM+4hJkCbs=",
}
```

The customer wallet uses the payment details to perform the payment over
Interledger using STREAM.

As payments are fulfilled, the `received` amount on the invoice would increase
to reflect the payments.

## 6. Check payment

The merchant would validate the payment of the invoice with its wallet. This
could be achieved through polling against the invoice or the wallet could
provide convenience web hooks for the merchant to get notified of successful
payments. This is left up to wallets to decide to implement.
