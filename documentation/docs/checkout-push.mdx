The following use case demonstrates a credit-push based retail payment example
between two parties, the merchant and a customer. The flow is initiated by the
merchant creating an invoice at its own wallet, which is then presented to the
customer. The customer can then present this invoice to its own wallet to
complete the payment.

## Flow

<Mermaid

/>

Based on the diagram above the flow is as follows:

1. Merchant creates an invoice at its wallet for the amount that it would like
   the customer to pay
2. Merchant presents the invoice/url to the customer.
3. Customer submits the invoice to its own wallet to pay the invoice
4. Merchant checks for payment of invoice

### 1. Creating Invoice at Acquirer

Below is a non-normative example of a merchant with a Payment Pointer of
`$aquirer.wallet/merchant` creating an invoice at its wallet. The merchant
creates the invoice by making a POST request to the `/merchant/invoices` path
with an invoice included as a JSON payload:

```http
POST /merchant/invoices HTTP/1.1
Host: acquirer.wallet
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 200,
  "description": "Order Number 1234"
}
```

A successful `201` response will return an invoice object. Below is a
non-normative example of a successful response to the creation of an invoice for
`$aquirer.wallet/merchant`.

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://acquirer.wallet/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e

{
  "id": "https://acquirer.wallet/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e",
  "account": "https://acquirer.wallet/merchant",
  "amount": 200
  "received": 0
}
```

### 2. Present invoice to customer

Once the merchant has the invoice, it would present the invoice to the customer.
This could be in the form of a URL or QRCode, or the merchant application could
redirect the sender to the sender's wallet to pay the invoice. This flow should
be left to individual merchants to implement.

### 3. Customer submits invoice to wallet

The customer can now submit the invoice to its wallet. If it's a URL it could
paste it into some dialog or if its a QRCode, they could scan it with their
native app. It is expected that the sending wallet would ask for confirmation
before executing an invoice payment.

#### Payment

To complete the payment the sending wallet would need to get payment details
from the invoice. By doing a GET against the invoice with the `Accept` header
set to `application/ilp-stream+json`, the sender can get the payment details
necessary to pay the invoice. In this example, the sender and receiver wish to
transact over Interledger, so the receiver would respond with an `ilpAddress`
and `sharedSecret`.

The following is a non-normative example of a wallet getting ILP payment details
for an invoice from the receiving wallet.

```http
GET /invoices/2d24bd87-1afc-465e-a4ec-07cb4f70f7b0 HTTP/1.1
Host: acquirer.wallet
Accept: application/ilp-stream+json
```

response

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/ilp-stream+json

{
  "ilpAddress": "g.aquirer.42e0f0c9284ad401b7c941bc6173f4e",
  "sharedSecret": "AvLaEGc+ojGHVezQF9DC4/7F5YIvrNPx/VM+4hJkCbs=",
}
```

The sending wallet would now use the payment details to perform the payment over
Interledger using STREAM.

As payments are fulfilled, the `received` amount on the invoice would increase
to reflect the payments.

### 4. Check payment

The merchant would validate the payment of the invoice with their wallet. This
could be achieved through polling against the invoice or the wallet could
provide convenience web-hooks for the merchant to get notified of successful
payments. This is left up to wallets to decide to implement.
