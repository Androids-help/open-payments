## APIs

### Create
Given a sender's Payment Pointer, a Client creates a Mandate by doing an HTTP POST of JSON document to the 
HTTP URL resolved from the Payment Pointer, with `/mandates` appended to the URL path.

The JSON document MUST include the following:
* amount
* assetCode
* assetScale
* subject

and MAY include the following:
* startAt
* expiresAt
* interval

The Open Payments Server MUST respond with a Mandate Response or an error (TDB).

The following is a non-normative example where the Client creates a mandate at the Issuing Wallet
for subject `$issuer.wallet/bob`

```http
POST /bob/mandates HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.wallet
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode" : "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "interval": "P1M",
  "subject": "$issuer.wallet/bob"
}
```

with a non-normative response from the Open Payments Server

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://issuer.wallet/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6
{
  "name": "https://issuer.wallet/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6",
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode" : "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "interval": "P1M",
  "startAt": "2020-01-22T00:00:00Z",
  "subject": "issuer.wallet/bob",
  "balance": 200
}
```

### Get

The Client reads the mandate by doing a HTTP GET of the corresponding Mandate name as URI. The Open Payments Server
MUST respond with either a Mandate Response or an Error (TBD)

The following is a non-normative example where the Client reads a mandate

```http
GET /mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6 HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.wallet
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi...

  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode" : "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "interval": "P1M",
