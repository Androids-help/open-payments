import { Mermaid } from './Mermaid'

The following use case demonstrates an individual performing a peer-to-peer
payment. The sender would present the Payment Pointer of the receiver to its own
wallet and instruct it to make a payment.

## Flow

<Mermaid
  chart={`sequenceDiagram
participant Sender
participant Issuer as Sending Wallet
participant Acquirer as Receiving Wallet
participant Receiver
Receiver->>Sender: Provide Payment Pointer
Sender->>Issuer: Initiate Payment (payment pointer)
activate Issuer
Issuer->>Acquirer: GET /{receiver}
Acquirer-->>Issuer: 200 account meta data
Issuer->>Sender: Prompt for amount (receiving asset)
Sender-->>Issuer: Confirm (amount)
Issuer->>Acquirer: POST /{receiver}/invoices
activate Issuer
activate Acquirer
Acquirer->>Acquirer: createInvoice(invoice)
Acquirer-->>Issuer: 201 Created<br/> Location: /invoices/{invoiceId}
deactivate Acquirer
deactivate Issuer
Issuer->>Acquirer: GET /invoices/{invoiceId}/connections
activate Acquirer
Acquirer-->>Issuer: 200 connection credentials
deactivate Acquirer
rect rgb(0, 255, 0)
    Issuer->>Acquirer: [ complete payment ]
    activate Acquirer
end
Acquirer->>Acquirer: updateInvoiceBalance(amount)
deactivate Acquirer
Issuer-->>Sender: Payment Successful
deactivate Issuer
`}
/>

Based on the diagram above the flow is as follows:

1. Sender submits payment to its own wallet
2. Sending wallet creates invoice on receivers wallet
3. Sending wallet pays invoice

### 1. Sender submits payment

The sender presents its wallet with the Payment Pointer of the receiver. The
wallet dereferences this to the account meta-data document for the receiver's
account which includes the asset code and scale of the account.

The sending wallet prompts the sender to provide the amount they want to send,
denominated in either the sender or the receiver's asset.

If the amount is denominated in the receiver's asset the sending wallet MUST
estimate the cost to the sender and allow them to set a maximum send amount
denominated in their asset.

The sending wallet MAY allow the sender to provide a description for the
payment.

### 2. Sending wallet creates invoice

Using the invoices API at the receiving wallet the sending wallet creates an
invoice. If the sender specified a receive amount for the payment then this will
be specified in the invoice, likewise with an invoice description.

Below is an example of a sending client creating an invoice for a fixed receive
amount of 1 USD.

```http
POST /bob/invoices HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "account": "https://wallet.example/bob",
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "amount": 100
}
```

The server would respond with a JSON payload containing the created Invoice,
including the URL of the Invoice:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://wallet.example/invoices/2d24bd87-1afc-465e-a4ec-07cb4f70f7b0

{
  "name": "https://wallet.example/invoices/2d24bd87-1afc-465e-a4ec-07cb4f70f7b0",
  "account": "https://wallet.example/bob",
  "amount": 100,
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "received": 0
}
```

### 3. Issuer Pays

#### Get Payment Details

To complete the payment the Issuer would need to get payment details from the
invoice. By doing a GET against the invoice with the `Accept` header set to
`application/ilp-stream+json`, the sender can get the payment details necessary
to pay the invoice (eg. `ilpAddress` and `sharedSecret`).

```http
GET /invoices/2d24bd87-1afc-465e-a4ec-07cb4f70f7b0 HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Accept: application/ilp-stream+json
```
returns

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 Success
Content-Type: application/ilp-stream+json

{
  "ilpAddress": "g.example.42e0f0c9284ad401b7c941bc6173f4e",
  "sharedSecret": "AvLaEGc+ojGHVezQF9DC4/7F5YIvrNPx/VM+4hJkCbs=",
}
```

#### Pay the Invoice

Once the sender has received payment details for the invoice, it can send the
payment to the receiver using the STREAM protocol.
