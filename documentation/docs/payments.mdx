title: Payment Details
---

Payment Details are a unique element of the Open Payment APIs. They represent
the payment details used to make payments to a receiver. This can either be
directly into an account, or toward an invoice linked to an account.

The payment details to make the payment are provided as part of either an
account or invoice resource but only when these are requested using alternative
media-types.

By default, a client requesting an account or invoice resource will use the
`application/json` media-type in the `Accept` header and the response should be
of that type and MUST NOT contain payment details.

However, clients using the [accounts](./accounts) or [invoices](./invoices) APIs
MAY specify alternative media-types in the `Accept` header and the server MUST
provide the appropriate payment details for that account or invoice embedded in
the account or invoice resource.

## Interledger STREAM

The `application/ilp-stream+json` representation of an invoice or account
resource includes the following **additional** properties for establishing a
STREAM connection and paying the receiver:

| Property     | Type        | Description                                                    |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ilpAddress   | ILP Address | The ILP address to use when establishing a STREAM connection   |
| sharedSecret | string      | The shared secret to use when establishing a STREAM connection |

## Simple Payment Setup Protocol

The `application/spsp4+json` representation of an invoice or account resource
contains ONLY the following properties for establishing a STREAM connection and
paying the receiver:

| Property            | Type        | Description                                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| destination_account | ILP Address | The ILP address to use when establishing a STREAM connection   |
| shared_secret       | string      | The shared secret to use when establishing a STREAM connection |

This ensures backwards compatibility with
[SPSP](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0009-simple-payment-setup-protocol/)
clients.

The following is a non-normative example where the client gets the details to
pay an account:

```http
GET alice HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Accept: application/spsp4+json
```

with a non-normative response from the Open Payments Server of:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/spsp4+json

{
  "destination_account": "example.alice.YB5X9FhSOUPCL~NjZjZTYwZDgtZjRiYS00YzYwLWJhNmUtZmM1ZTBhYTk5OTIz",
  "shared_secret": "6jR5iNIVRvqeasJeCty6C+YB5X9FhSOUPCL/5nha5Vs="
}
```
