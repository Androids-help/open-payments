import { Mermaid } from './Mermaid'

Open Payments is a REST API with 4 resource definitions:

- [accounts](./accounts)
- [invoices](./invoices)
- [mandates](./mandates)
- [charges](./charges)

The API also defines **alternative resource representations** for invoices and
accounts that contain [payment details](./payments) for making payments against
those invoices or into those accounts.

The URL of the **accounts** resource is [discovered](./discovery) by the client
and all other endpoints are then relative to that URL. As shown in the ERD below
the root resource is an **account**.

Accounts have 2 sub-resources, **invoices** and **mandates** and APIs are
defined to both create and get invoices and mandates under the account.

Mandates have a **charges** sub-resource which has a create API allowing clients
to create a new charge against the mandate. In most cases the charge will
reference an invoice on the **client's** system describing the details of the
charge that is being requested.

## APIs

All API endpoints are relative to the URL of the account that is the root of the
interaction.

Specifically, the URL of any sub-resource API endpoint is the result of
performing the URL parsing algorithm in
[WHATWG URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-parsing) where:

- _input_ is the sub-resource relative URL, and
- _base_ is the resource URL

For example, for the account resource URL `https://wallet.example/alice` the
invoice API endpoint/sub-resource URL for that account is
`https://wallet.example/alice/invoices`

### Create

All resources are created using an HTTP `POST` request to the API endpoint.

A successful response to a create request has an HTTP `201 Created` response
code and a `Location` header containing the URL of the newly created resource.

The resource is also returned in the body of the response.

Clients that wish to have payment details returned for a newly created invoice
resource MUST specify an alternative media-type in the `Accept` header of the
create request as defined in the [payment details API](./payments)

### Get

Resources can be accessed using an HTTP `GET` request.

Sub-resources are accessed at URLs relative to the parent resource URL.

## Authorization

All APIs MAY be protected by the Open Payments server. The default mechanism for
accessing protected resources is to provide a bearer token in the authorization
header of the request as described in
[RFC 6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750).

The example below shows a request to get payment details using an access token:

```http
     GET /alice HTTP/1.1
     Host: wallet.example
     Accept: application/ilp-stream+json
     Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM
```

If a client is unable to access a resource anonymously and receives a `401`
response code it may attempt to get an access token using OAuth 2 via the
authorization endpoint defined in the account meta-data.

Servers that receive anonymous requests for a protected resource must respond
with a `401` response code and the `WWW-Authenticate` header per
[RFC 6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750).

An example of such a response is shown below:

```http
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
     WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
```

### Getting an access token

> **TODO:** This section needs to be fleshed out but will follow the OAuth 2
> framework with the RAR extension to describe how a client uses the
> authorization endpoint they get from the account meta-data to request a grant
> from the account owner (or the account servicer if the use case permits) and
> exchange this for an access token.
