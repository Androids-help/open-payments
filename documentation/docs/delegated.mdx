title: Delegated Access
---

One of the advantages of a standard protocol for interaction between wallets is
that it can be leveraged by 3rd parties to provide sending and receiving
services to account owners who delegate access to their account to the 3rd
party.

By using the [mandates API](./mandates) 3rd parties can request authorization
from an account owner to initiate payments from their account (once-off, on a
recurring basis, now, or at future date).

The mandate gives the account owner granular control over the amount and
frequency of the payments, and the discovery protocol provides a seamless way
for account owners to share their account details with the 3rd party.

Using mandates puts control back in the account owner's hands. Wallets should
allow account owners to manage and cancel mandates via the wallet application.
This differs from current systems based on credit cards where the account owner
is unable to withdraw access to their account without cancelling the card.

It's important to note that a mandate does not provide any guarantees of funds
within the account. It merely specifies the terms under which the 3rd party is
authorized to initiate transactions on behalf of the account owner.

## Mandates

The main building block of delegated access within Open Payments is the
[mandate resource](./mandates). A mandate enables a 3rd-party application and
the account owner to define the terms of the delegated access. This includes:

- Amount
- Frequency
- Currency
- Expiry

The typical flow for a 3rd party application to request delegated access to an
account would be:

1. The account owner provides the application with a Payment Pointer
2. The application discovers the account URL and mandates API URL
3. The application creates a mandate against the account
4. The application initiates authorization of the mandate

An account owner would provide their Payment Pointer to the application, an
example is `$wallet.example/alice`. The application would use Open Payments
[discovery](./discovery) to determine the mandate API endpoint for the account.
Once the application knows the endpoint it can create a mandate.

An example of an application creating a mandate for \$2.00 every month is:

```http
POST /alice/mandates HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode" : "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "interval": "P1M",
}
```

where the response would be:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://wallet.example/alice/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6

{
  "name": "https://wallet.example/alice/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6",
  "account": "https://wallet.example/alice"
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode" : "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "interval": "P1M",
  "startAt": "2020-01-22T00:00:00Z",
  "balance": 200
}
```

Once the application has created the mandate, it needs to get authorization from
the account owner to create charges against the mandate. The application will
use the authorization URL it discovered when
[getting the account meta-data](./accounts) earlier.

Open Payments uses the Rich Authorization Requests extension for OAuth 2 as
defined in [Authorization](./auth).

An example of the `authorization_details` object for the mandate above is:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "https://openpayments.dev/charges",
    "locations": [
      "https://wallet.example/alice/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6"
    ],
    "scopes": ["read"]
  },
  {
    "type": "https://openpayments.dev/charges",
    "locations": [
      "https://wallet.example/alice/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6/charges"
    ],
    "scopes": ["create", "read_own"]
  }
]
```

The application will use the `authorization_details` in conjunction with the
authorization endpoint to initiate the authorization flow for the mandate.

An example of the application redirecting the account owner to their wallet for
authorization is:

```http request

GET /authorize?response_type=code&client_id=s6BhdRkqt3&state=af0ifjsldkj
  &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb
  &authorization_details=%7B%0A%20%20%22open_payments%22%3A%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%22mandate%22%3A%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%22name%22%3A%20%22%2F%2Fissuer.wallet%2Fmandates%2F2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6%22%0A%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
```

This will initiate an OAuth2 consent flow for the account owner with its wallet.
Once the account owner has consented to the mandate the application will get a
callback at the specified `redirect_uri`.

> **NOTE:** The wallet MUST provide the user with an easy to understand
> description of the terms of the mandate and allow the user to set upper and
> lower bounds for the payment in the currency of the sending account.
>
> Learn more about [currencies](./currency) in Open Payments.

Finally, the application will be able to convert the grant code from the
redirect into an `access_token`. This `access_token` is used for any subsequent
interactions with the mandate, including the ability to initiate a charge
against the mandate.

## Charges

Now that an application has a mandate and has authorization to create charges
against it, it can begin initiating transactions against the underlying account.

This is achieved through creating [charges](./charges#create) against the
mandate. The new charge describes the amount that must be sent and to whom.

The simplest format of a charge is a reference to an invoice at the receiver.

```json
{
  "invoice": "https://otherwallet.example/bob/invoices/15fdd9ce-5535-42a3-8042-848073ace4b7"
}
```

Alternative formats may be developed in the future.

### Application usage

In order for an application to perform charges, it first needs an invoice. This
invoice can either be one created by the application or be given to the
application by another party. The application would submit this invoice to the
`/charges` endpoint along with the `access_token` it received from the
authorization flow.

An example of the application doing this is:

```http
POST /alice/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6/charges HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "invoice": "https://otherwallet.example/bob/invoices/15fdd9ce-5535-42a3-8042-848073ace4b7"
}
```

with a successful response of:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://wallet.example/alice/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6/charges/a395a5c0-f9cd-48bd-9c1a-19fb4d312d53

{
  "name": "https://wallet.example/alice/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6/charges/a395a5c0-f9cd-48bd-9c1a-19fb4d312d53",
  "invoice": "https://otherwallet.example/bob/invoices/15fdd9ce-5535-42a3-8042-848073ace4b7",
  "mandate": "https://wallet.example/alice/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6"
  "status": "created"
}
```

This will instruct the wallet to perform a payment against the invoice under the
terms of the mandate.

The wallet must perform this payment immediately, if the funds are available.

The application can query the charge or the invoice to determine the status of
the payment.
