### Account

An **account** represents the financial relationship between a user (the account
owner) and a wallet (account servicer). In Open Payments every account has one
or more Payment Pointer URLs that represents the account.

From ISO 20022 -
[Account](https://www.iso20022.org/standardsrepository/type/Account):

> Record of transactions in specific types of assets, maintained by a servicing
> party on behalf of one or more owning parties. Business relationship between
> an account servicer and one or more account owners.

### Account Servicer

The **account servicer** refers to a role played in the ecosystem by an entity
that services accounts on behalf of the account owner.

From ISO 20022 -
[AccountServicerRole](https://www.iso20022.org/standardsrepository/type/AccountServicerRole):

> Party that manages the account on behalf of the account owner, that is manages
> the registration and booking of entries on the account, calculates balances on
> the account and provides information about the account.

In Open Payments, the account servicers are host an Open Payments
[Server](#server) and also use an Open Payments [Client](#client) to interact
with other account servicers via their Open Payments Servers.

For brevity, account servicers are simply referred to as [wallets](#wallet) in
the Open payments documentation.

Throughout the the Open Payments documentation this is used as a generic label
for the entity that services either the sender's or receiver's account.
