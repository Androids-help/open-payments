title: Authorization

Authorization is a key part of Open Payments.

All API endpoints can be protected as determined by the wallet and account owner
based on their requirements.

For example, the [invoices API](./invoices) might be open by default for all
accounts but protected by account owners that don't want to receive unsolicited
payments. Another wallet that attempts to create an invoice will get a `401`
error indicating the permissions that are required and must then get an access
token in order to retry the request.

Getting authorization to access an Open Payments API resource is done using the
OAuth 2.0 protocol and authenticated access to any resource or API is done using
bearer tokens as described in [RFC 6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750).

Using OAuth2 allows the resource owner (the owner of the underlying account) to
enforce that they always grant access to clients explicitly.

This improves on the state of most retail payments today where stolen credit
card details can lead to payments without the account owner's consent.

OAuth2 doesn't support fine grained access to resources so an an extension to
the protocol called
[Rich Authorization Requests (RAR)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lodderstedt-oauth-rar-03)
is used in Open Payments. This allows clients to specify a fine-grained access
to a singular account, connection, invoice, mandate or charge using a JSON
structure.

> **Note:** OAuth2 is a front-channel based authorization framework which makes

## Authorization Details and RAR

In order to ensure interoperability between client and authentication server
(AS) for authorization, it is necessary to define a standard data structure for
the `authorization_details` sent by the client.

Per the latest
[specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-rar-01#section-2.1)
the object MUST contain an array of objects, each with a `type`, `locations` and
`actions` property.

- `type` is one of the resource types defined in Open Payments
- `locations` is any array of URLs that provide the location of the resources
- `actions` is an array of actions that the client is requesting permission to
  perform on the resource.

In general, the `actions` defined are `create`, `read`, `update` and `delete`.
In addition to this, clients can be given `read_own`, `update_own` and
`delete_own` permissions which allows them to read, update and delete resources
that they have created. This allows a client to proactively request, for
example, access to a resource that does not yet exist but which they will
create.

Details on the available actions are listed in the relevant
[API documents](./api). Note that at this time, none of the APIs support updates
or deletes.

Below is an example of a request for permission to create charges on a mandate
and read the state of any charges created:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "https://openpayments.dev/charges",
    "locations": [
      "https://wallet.example/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6/charges"
    ],
    "scopes": ["create", "read_own"]
  }
]
```
