Charges represent objects with which Clients can instruct Wallets to perform a Payment to an Invoice within the scope
of a Mandate. Wallets MUST implement the Charges API on conjunction with Mandates.

| Property    | Type           |
|-------------|----------------|
| id          | UUID           |
| invoice     | int64          |
| mandate     | int64          |
| status      | enum           |

## APIs

### Create

A Client creates a Charge by doing an HTTP POST of JSON document to an endpoint constructed by appending `/charges` on
the Mandate URI for which they wish to perform the Charge against.

The JSON document MUST include the following:

* invoice

The Open Payments Server MUST respond with a Charge Response or an error (TDB).

The following is a non-normative example of a Client creating a Charge against a Mandate.

```http
POST /mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6/charges HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.wallet
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi...
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "invoice": "//acquirer.wallet/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e",
}
```

with a non-normative response from the Open Payments Server:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "//issuer.wallet/charges/a395a5c0-f9cd-48bd-9c1a-19fb4d312d53",
  "invoice": "//aquirer.wallet/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e",
  "mandate": "//issuer.wallet/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6",
  "status": "created"
}
```

### Get

The Client reads the Charge by doing a HTTP GET of the corresponding Charge name as URI. The Open Payments Server
MUST respond with either a Charge Response or an Error (TBD).

The following is a non-normative example where the Client reads an Charge:

```http
GET /charges/a395a5c0-f9cd-48bd-9c1a-19fb4d312d53 HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.wallet
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi...
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "//issuer.wallet/charges/a395a5c0-f9cd-48bd-9c1a-19fb4d312d53",
  "invoice": "//aquirer.wallet/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e",
  "mandate": "//issuer.wallet/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6",
  "status": "succesful"
}
```
