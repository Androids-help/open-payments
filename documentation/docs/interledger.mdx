The [Interledger protocol (ILP)](https://interledger.org) is a minimalistic
payments clearing protocol. It was developed to mimic many of the
characteristics of the Internet Protocol stack in order to “internetwork”
clearing participants. The effect of using this model is a highly scalable and
simple global clearing network on which rapid innovation is possible. Using ILP,
participants “peer” with other network participants and exchange clearing
instructions (ILP packets) directly or indirectly with other participants on the
network.

The advantage of using ILP over other clearing protocols is that it has been
explicitly designed to facilitate high interoperability between participants
irrespective of the use case. Senders and receivers establish the terms of the
payment before starting to exchange ILP packets to clear the funds. As a result,
technologies built on ILP are not siloed by the payment networks they choose to
support.

Open Payments is the successor to the
[Simple Payment Setup Protocol (SPSP)](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0009-simple-payment-setup-protocol/),
an application layer protocol with limited support for use cases beyond 
[Web Monetization](./web-monetization).

Open Payments is backwards compatible with SPSP but supports an increased set of
use cases.
