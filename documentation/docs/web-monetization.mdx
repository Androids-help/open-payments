Web Monetization is the use of a [STREAM](./terminology#stream) connection to
send money from a Web browser to the Payment Pointer of a website. In this way
the user visiting the website reimburses the website for the content she
consumes.

Web Monetization is an emerging Web standard and more information can be found
at [webmonetization.org](https://webmonetization.org).

The general principal of Web Monetization (streaming money with no predetermined
amount) can be applied to other scenarios such as paying a for server resources
(See [codius.org](https://codius.org))

Open Payments has been designed to be backwards compatible with Web Monetization
which uses the
[Simple Payment Setup Protocol (SPSP)](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0009-simple-payment-setup-protocol/)
to setup a STREAM connection starting with the Payment Pointer the client parses
from the receiver's website.

## Flow

<Mermaid
  chart={`sequenceDiagram
participant Browser
participant Provider as Sending Wallet
participant Wallet as Receiving Wallet
Browser->>Browser: Parse Payment Pointer
Browser->>Wallet: GET /{receiver} <br/> Accept: application/spsp4+json
Wallet-->>Browser: 200 STREAM credentials
rect rgb(0, 255, 0)
    Browser->>Provider: [ stream payments ]
    Provider->>Wallet: 
end
`}
/>

Based on the diagram above the flow is as follows:

1. Browser parses the website's Payment Pointer from the page
2. Browser gets STREAM credentials for website's receiving account
3. Browser (via user's wallet) opens a STREAM connection to the receiver and
   starts streaming payments

### 1. Browser parses Payment Pointer

The browser will look for the websites Payment Pointer in a `<meta>` tag in the
page.

### 2. Browser gets STREAM credentials

The browser fetches the `application/ilp-stream+json` representation of the
account resource at the URL decoded from the Payment Pointer

A non-normative example is

```http request
GET /alice HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Accept: application/ilp-stream+json
```

with the response returning the STREAM credentials for the account.

```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/ilp-stream+json

{
  "ilpAddress": "example.ilpdemo.red.bob",
  "sharedSecret": "6jR5iNIVRvqeasJeCty6C+YB5X9FhSOUPCL/5nha5Vs="
}
```

Further, the endpoint should support parameters for encoding data into STREAM
connection details. These are supported as header values in the request. The
following are values that must be supported as per the STREAM spec:

- Receipt-Nonce
- Receipt-Secret
- Session-Id

### 3. Browser starts streaming payments

Using the credentials it has received from the receiver the browser establishes
a STREAM connection and begins paying.

## Backwards compatibility with SPSP

Open Payments defines a new media-type for getting STREAM credentials:
`application/ilp-stream+json`. To ensure backward compatibility with SPSP and
legacy Web Monetization clients Open Payments servers MUST also support the
media-type: `application/spsp4+json`.

If a client accepts both types, the server MUST send an
`application/ilp-stream+json` representation as a response.

The following request is an example of a legacy SPSP request:

```http request
GET /alice HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Accept: application/spsp4+json, application/spsp+json
```

The server MUST respond with a legacy format response, an example of which is
shown below:

```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/spsp4+json

{
  "destination_account": "example.ilpdemo.red.bob",
  "shared_secret": "6jR5iNIVRvqeasJeCty6C+YB5X9FhSOUPCL/5nha5Vs="
}
```

**IMPORTANT**: The property names in the `application/ilp-stream+json` response
are different to those in the `application/spsp4+json` response.

| Media Type    | `application/ilp-stream+json` | `application/spsp4+json` |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| ILP Address   | `ilpAddress`                  | `destination_account`    |
| Shared Secret | `sharedSecret`                | `shared_secret`          |
