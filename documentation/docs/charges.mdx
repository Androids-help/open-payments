Charges represent instructions by a client to perform a payment from the account
against which the mandate was created. The existence of the mandate does not
imply that the client has authorization to initiate payments, the client MUST
have authorization to create charges against the mandate.

## Resource Representation

The `application/json` representation of an invoice resource provides the
details of the invoice as a JSON document.

| Property | Type | Description                                        |
| -------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| id       | URL  | The URL identifying the invoice                    |
| mandate  | URL  | The mandate against which the charge is being made |
| invoice  | URL  | The invoice which is being paid via this charge    |
| status   | enum | TBD                                                |

## APIs

The charges API endpoint is relative to the mandate that is being charged using
the sub-resource URL: **`./charges`**

Specifically, the URL of the charges API endpoint is the result of performing
the URL parsing algorithm in
[WHATWG URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-parsing) where:

- _input_ is `./charges`, and
- _base_ is the mandate URL

For example, for the mandate URL `https://wallet.example/mandates/7236rf76` the
charges API endpoint for that mandate is
`https://wallet.example/mandates/7236rf76/charges`

### Create

A client creates an invoice by doing an HTTP POST of a JSON document to the
charges API endpoint.

The JSON document MUST include the following:

- invoice

The Open Payments server MUST respond with a `201 Created` response or an error
(TDB). The response MUST contain the newly created charge and a `Location`
response header with the URL of the newly created charge.

The following is a non-normative example of a client creating a charge against a
mandate identified by
`https://wallet.example/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6`.

```http
POST /mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6/charges HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi...
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "invoice": "https://otherwallet.example/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e",
}
```

with a non-normative response from the Open Payments Server:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://wallet.example/charges/a395a5c0-f9cd-48bd-9c1a-19fb4d312d53
{
  "id": "https://wallet.example/charges/a395a5c0-f9cd-48bd-9c1a-19fb4d312d53",
  "invoice": "https://otherwallet.example/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e",
  "mandate": "https://wallet.example/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6",
  "status": "created"
}
```

### Get

The client reads the charge by doing an HTTP GET of the corresponding charge
URL. The Open Payments server MUST respond with either a charge or an error
(TBD).

The following is a non-normative example where the client reads a charge:

```http
GET /charges/a395a5c0-f9cd-48bd-9c1a-19fb4d312d53 HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi...
Accept: application/json
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 Success
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "https://wallet.example/charges/a395a5c0-f9cd-48bd-9c1a-19fb4d312d53",
  "invoice": "https://otherwallet.example/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e",
  "mandate": "https://wallet.example/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6",
  "status": "succesful"
}
```
