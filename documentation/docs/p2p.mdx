import { Mermaid } from './Mermaid'

The following use case demonstrates an individual performing a peer-to-peer payment. The user would present the 
Payment Pointer of the Receiver to its own Wallet (Issuer) and instruct it to make a payment. 

<Mermaid chart={`sequenceDiagram

# Flow

Based on the diagram above the flow is as follows:
1. Sender submits payment to its own wallet
2. Issuer wallet gets Open Payment metadata
3. Issuer wallet creates invoice on receivers wallet
3. Issuer pays invoice

## 1. Sender submits payment

The sender presents the Payment Pointer of the Receiver to its Issuer to instruct it to make a Peer-to-Peer payment

## 2. Discover Open Payments metadata

Using the Payment Pointer provided, the Merchant will perform a GET against the correct url.

```http
GET /.well-known/open-payments-server HTTP/1.1
Host: aquirer.wallet
```

A successful `200` response will return the Open Payments metadata

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "issuer": "https://aquirer.wallet",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://aquirer.wallet/authorize",
  "token_endpoint": "https://aquirer.wallet/token",
  "token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported": ["client_secret_basic","private_key_jwt"],
  "token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported": ["RS256", "ES256"],
  "userinfo_endpoint": "https://aquirer.wallet/userinfo",
  "jwks_uri": "https://aquirer.wallet/jwks.json",
  "registration_endpoint": "https://aquirer.wallet/register",
  "scopes_supported": ["openid","profile","email","address","phone","offline_access"],
  "response_types_supported": ["code", "token"],
  "service_documentation": "https://aquirer.wallet/service_documentation.html",
  "ui_locales_supported": ["en-US", "en-GB", "en-CA", "fr-FR", "fr-CA"],
  "payment_invoices_endpoint": "https://aquirer.wallet/invoices",
  "payment_mandates_endpoint": "https://aquirer.wallet/mandates",
  "payment_sessions_endpoint": "https://aquirer.wallet/sessions",
  "payment_assets_supported": [
    {"code": "USD", "scale": 2},
    {"code": "EUR", "scale": 2}
  ]
}
```

The Merchant can now find `payment_mandates_endpoint` with which to create the necessary mandate

## 3. Issuer creates invoice 

The Issuer would create an invoice on the Acquirer for the amount the sender wanted to send to the receiver.

```http
POST /invoices HTTP/1.1
Host: acquirer.wallet
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi...
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "subject": "$acquirer.wallet/receiver",
  "asset": {
    "code": "USD",
    "scale": 2
  },
  "amount": 100
}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://acquirer.wallet/sessions/2d24bd87-1afc-465e-a4ec-07cb4f70f7b0

{
  "name": "//acquirer.wallet/invoices/2d24bd87-1afc-465e-a4ec-07cb4f70f7b0",
  "subject": "$acquirer.wallet/receiver",
  "amount": 200,
  "asset": {
    "code": "USD",
    "scale": 2
  },
  "received": 0
}
```

## 4. Issuer Pays

### Payment

To complete the payment the Issuer would need to get payment details from the invoice. By doing a GET against
the invoice it can get the required `destination_address` and `shared_secret`.

```http
GET /invoices/2d24bd87-1afc-465e-a4ec-07cb4f70f7b0 HTTP/1.1
Host: acquirer.wallet
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "subject": "$acquirer.wallet/receiver",
  "asset": {
    "code": "USD",
    "scale": 2
  },
  "amount": 100,
  "received": 0,
  "destination_address": "g.aquirer.42e0f0c9284ad401b7c941bc6173f4e",
  "shared_secret": "AvLaEGc+ojGHVezQF9DC4/7F5YIvrNPx/VM+4hJkCbs=",
}
```

The Issuer would the STREAM the money to the details given.
