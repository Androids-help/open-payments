Connections represent a connection to an account via
[STREAM](./terminology#STREAM).

| Property     | Type        |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| ilpAddress   | ILP Address |
| sharedSecret | string      |

## APIs

### Create

Create is not supported for connections.

### Get

The client gets unique connection credentials by doing an HTTP GET against an
account or invoice resource using the sub-resource path `connection`.

The Open Payments server SHOULD return a unique address and shared secret on
every request.

The following is a non-normative example where the client gets a connection:

```http
GET invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e/connection HTTP/1.1
Host: acquirer.wallet
Accept: application/connection+json
```

with a non-normative response from the Open Payments Server of:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/connection+json

{
  "ilpAddress": "example.alice.YB5X9FhSOUPCL~NjZjZTYwZDgtZjRiYS00YzYwLWJhNmUtZmM1ZTBhYTk5OTIz",
  "sharedSecret": "6jR5iNIVRvqeasJeCty6C+YB5X9FhSOUPCL/5nha5Vs="
}
```

## TODO
