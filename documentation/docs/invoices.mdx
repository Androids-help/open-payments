## APIs

### Create

Given a receiver's payment identifier (e.g., a Payment Pointer) a Client creates an Invoice by doing an HTTP POST of a JSON document to the 
HTTP URL resolved from the Payment Pointer, with `/invoices` appended to the URL path.

The JSON document MUST include the following:

* amount
* assetCode
* assetScale
* subject

and MAY include the following:
* description

The Open Payments Server MUST respond with an Invoice Response or an error (TDB).

The following is a non-normative example where the Client created an invoice for the subject `$acquirer.wallet/alice` at the Acquirer Wallet:

```http
POST /alice/invoices HTTP/1.1
Host: acquirer.wallet
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi...
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "subject": "$acquirer.wallet/alice",
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "amount": 200,
  "description": "Paying for goods"
}
```

with a non-normative response from the Open Payments Server:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://acquirer.wallet/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e

{
  "name": "https://acquirer.wallet/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e",
  "subject": "$acquirer.wallet/alice",
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "description": "Paying for goods"
  "received": 0
}
```

### Get

The Client reads the invoice by doing a HTTP GET of the corresponding Invoice name as URI. The Open Payments Server
MUST respond with either an Invoice Response or an Error (TBD).

The following is a non-normative example where the Client reads an invoice:

```http
GET /invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e HTTP/1.1
Host: acquirer.wallet
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi...
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "https://acquirer.wallet/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e",
  "subject": "$acquirer.wallet/alice",
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "description": "Paying for goods",
  "received": 158
}
```

### Payment Details

The Client gets the payment details of an Invoice by doing an HTTP GET of the corresponding Invoice name as a URI, with an
`Accept` HTTP header of `application/connection+json`. The Open Payments Server MUST respond with either an Payment Details 
Response or an Error (TBD).

The following is a non-normative example of a Client getting the payment details for an invoice:

```http
GET invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e HTTP/1.1
Host: acquirer.wallet
Accept: application/connection+json
```

with a non-normative response from the Open Payments Server of:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://acquirer.wallet/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e

{
  "ilpAddress": "example.alice.YB5X9FhSOUPCL~NjZjZTYwZDgtZjRiYS00YzYwLWJhNmUtZmM1ZTBhYTk5OTIz",
  "sharedSecret": "6jR5iNIVRvqeasJeCty6C+YB5X9FhSOUPCL/5nha5Vs="
}
