import { Mermaid } from './Mermaid'

The following use case demonstrates a 3rd Party Payment Initiation (3PPI) flow. This flow allows a user to authenticate 
a Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP) to make payments on the users behalf without having to hold or be in the flow of money. Example use cases include:
* Authenticating an app for in-app payments
* Authentication existing 3PPI's like Google/Apple Pay.

# Flow

Based on the diagram above the flow is as follows:
1. User provides payment identifier (eg. Payment Pointer)
2. Create Mandate and Authenticate PISP
3. Initiate payments

## 1.  User provides Payment Identifier

When a user would like to authenticate a new PISP it will provide them with their payment identifier such as a Payment Pointer.

## 2. Authenticate PISP

The PISP creates a mandate on the Users Issuer's wallet by sending a POST request to the wallet. This mandate will contain the permissions
with which the PISP can operate on the Users behalf.

```http
POST /sender/mandate HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.wallet
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "interval": "P1M",
  "subject": "$issuer.wallet/alice"
}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "https://issuer.wallet/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6",
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "interval": "P1M",
  "start_at": "2020-01-22T00:00:00Z",
  "subject": "$issuer.wallet/alice",
  "balance": 200 
}
```

The PISP submits the mandate to the AS of the Issuer in order get authorization from the User. Once the User has 
authorized the mandate, the PISP will receive an access_token with which to use against the mandate.

## 3. Initiate payments
Using the created invoice it will submit a charge against the mandate using the invoice name

```http
POST /mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6/charges HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.wallet
Authorization: Bearer random_auth_token
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "invoice": "https://acquirer.wallet/invoices/2d24bd87-1afc-465e-a4ec-07cb4f70f7b0"
}

```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```
Whenever the PISP wants to initiate a payment on the User behalf, it will submit a charge against the 
mandate using the invoice name. This will instruct the Issuer to complete the payment.

```http
POST /mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6/charges HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.wallet
Authorization: Bearer random_auth_token
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "invoice": "https://acquirer.wallet/invoices/2d24bd87-1afc-465e-a4ec-07cb4f70f7b0"
}

```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```
