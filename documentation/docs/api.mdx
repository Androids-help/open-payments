Open Payments is a REST API with 4 resource definitions:
[connections](./connections), [invoices](./invoices), [mandates](./mandates),
and [charges](./charges).

## APIs

### Create

All resources are created using an HTTP `POST` request to the API endpoint,
however [connections](./connections) don't support the create operation.

A successful response to a create request has an HTTP `201 Created` response
code and a `Location` header containing the URL of the newly created resource.

The resource is also returned in the body of the response.

### Get

Resources can be accessed using an HTTP `GET` request.

## Authorization

All APIs MAY be protected by the Open Payments server. The default mechanism for
accessing protected resources is to provide a bearer token in the authorization
header of the request.

If a client is unable to access a resource it can attempt to get an access token
using OAuth2 via the Open Payments server's authorization endpoint.

The URL of the resource that the client wishes to access MUST be used as the
requested scope in the OAuth2 authorization request.
