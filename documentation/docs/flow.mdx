import { PersonToPerson } from './personToPerson'
import { RequestToPay } from './requestToPay'

Once the client has discovered the URL of the account at the server, they use
the APIs on the server to setup and complete the payment. The specific APIs that
are used and the order they are accessed will differ based on the
[use case](./p2p) however the general flow is described here.

## Creating Invoices vs Paying into Accounts

All Open Payments interactions conclude with a payment, sent either directly
into an account or sent as payment of an invoice linked to an account.

The purpose of the setup is to exchange the details required to finalise the
terms of the payment and ultimately for the sender to get the payment details it
requires to connect to the receiver and make the payment.

As an example, Interledger payments are always sent using the
[STREAM protocol](./terminology#stream) which requires that the sender has
connection credentials to begin sending the payment. These credentials are the
payment details required by teh sender to make the payment.

The majority of payments are made toward an invoice and the outcome of the setup
is creation of an [invoice](./invoices) at the receiver, following which, the
sender will get [payment details](./payments) linked to that invoice.

The exception to this are use cases that have no discreet payment amount such as
[web monetization](./web-monetization). In this case the payment details will be
linked to the receiver's [account](./accounts) and not a specific invoice.

Irrespective of whether the sender is paying an invoice or paying into an
account, they will have a URL representing the resource and will get the payment
details by making a request **to that URL** using the appropriate media-type and
parsing the payment details from the returned document as defined in the
[payment details API](./payments).

## Sending Money

To send a specific amount of money the sender creates an invoice via the
[invoice API](./invoices) at the receiver and gets the payment details for that
invoice as defined in the [payment details API](./payments).

For use cases such as Web Monetization, with no fixed amount, no invoice is
created and the URL of the **receiving account** is used to get the
[payment details](./payments) instead.

Using the details it receives, the sender makes the payment.

For example, if the payment details are for payment via Interledger, the sender
opens a STREAM connection and starts sending payments until either the invoice
is paid, the amount sent exceeds a maximum set by the sender, or the sender
chooses to stop sending (e.g. moves away from a Web page it was paying via Web
Monetization).

A code example using the
[javascript STREAM client](https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-protocol-stream)
is shown below.

```javascript
const connection = await createConnection({
  plugin: getPlugin(),
  destinationAccount,
  sharedSecret,
})

const stream = connection.createStream()
await stream.sendTotal(200)
stream.end()
```

The sending wallet SHOULD debit the senders account before performing the
payment and should the payment fail or only partially succeed, the wallet must
credit the unsent balance back to the senders account.

## Receiving Money

In order to receive money over Open Payments, an invoice resource is created at
the receiving wallet and the URL of the invoice is presented to the sender.

If the payment has been pre-authorized then the invoice is submitted as part of
a [charge](./charges) against an authorized [mandate](./mandates).

Receiving wallets must:

1. Ensure the payment details they provide to clients can be mapped back to the
   invoice when the incoming payments are received
2. Credit the **paid** balance of the invoice for any incoming payments using
   payment details that are mapped to that invoice

### 1. Mapping the connection to the invoice with ILP and STREAM

[STREAM](./terminology#stream) provides a mechanism for encoding data into an
ILP address (shown as `destinationAccount` below) using a **Connection Tag**.
This allows the receiving wallet to encode data into the address that can then
be decoded when accepting an incoming connection.

The following shows an example of encoding data into the credentials provided to
the sender.

```javascript
const { encodeData } = require('encoder')
const connectionTag = encodeData(invoiceId)
const { destinationAccount, sharedSecret } = server.generateAddressAndSecret(
  connectionTag
)
```

The receiving wallet can now decode the data when it receives an incoming STREAM
and knows which invoice to allocate any payments received.

### 2. Accounting for an incoming Payment

As shown above, the receiving wallet can use the encoded invoice data to
determine which invoice to credit for incoming STREAM payments.

The following shows example code of what the wallet would do:

```javascript
const { createServer } = require('ilp-protocol-stream')
const { decodeData } = require('encoder')
const { creditInvoice } = require('invoice')

const streamServer = await createServer({
  plugin: getPlugin(),
})

streamServer.on('connection', (connection) => {
  // Determine who this connection belongs to by correlating with connectionTag
  const connectionTag = connection.connectionTag

  // Get the invoiceId from the connectionTag
  const invoiceId = decodeData(connectionTag)

  connection.on('stream', (stream) => {
    //Set how much you want to allow for this STREAM.
    stream.setReceiveMax(10000000000000)

    stream.on('money', (amount) => {
      // Credit the invoice for the amount received
      creditInvoice(invoiceId, amount)
    })
  })
})
```
