Owners represent the entity that owns an account. The owner resource can be used
to discover the accounts owned by the entity, in order to setup a payment to or
from the account.

## Resource Representation

The `application/json` representation of an owner resource provides the details
of the owner as a JSON document.

| Property | Type  | Description                      |
| -------- | ----- | -------------------------------- |
| id       | URL   | The URL identifying the owner    |
| accounts | array | The accounts owned by the entity |

The `accounts` property holds an array of account objects as described below:

| Property   | Type   | Description                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id         | URL    | The URL of the account resource                                                   |
| assetCode  | string | The asset code of the amount (inherited from the underlying account)              |
| assetScale | int32  | The scale of the amount (inherited from the underlying account)                   |
| mediaTypes | array  | An array of media-types that can be requested when accessing the account resource |

## APIs

The owners API endpoint/resource URL is the URL discovered by the client through
the [Open Payments PayID discovery](./payid) process.

### Create

Create is not supported for owners.

### Get

The following request is a non-normative example of a request for the meta-data
for the account identified by the PayID: `alice$wallet.example`

```http
GET /$/alice HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Accept: application/json
```

The returned JSON document MUST contain the following claims:

- `id` URL identifying the account owner.
- `accounts` an array of account object as defined below.

#### Accounts

Each account object returned in the `accounts` array MUST contain the following
claims:

- `id` URL identifying the account. This is the account resource URL and can be
  used as the basis for further Open Payments interaction on the account.
- `assetCode` the currency of the account.
- `assetScale` the natural scale of the account relative to the natural scale of
  the asset. This is expressed as an integer which is the power of 10 that the
  account balance must be divided by to get to the natural scale of the asset.
  For example, if the asset is USD then a scale of 2 implies that the balance is
  tracked in USD cents. (Must be divided by 100 to be show USD)
- `mediaTypes` an array of strings that are valid media types for this account.

#### Media Types

By default, [account](./accounts) and [invoice](./invoices) resources are
represented using the `application/json` media type.

However, clients may request alternative representations which include
additional payment details for payments into the account or against the invoice
as described in the [payment details API](./payments).

An example of such a media type is `application/ilp-stream+json` which will
supplement the default representation with two additional properties the
`ilpAddress` and `sharedSecret` which are used by the client to make payments to
the account or against the invoice.

The `mediaTypes` property of `account` objects returned in a response provide
the set of media types that MAY be requested for the account.

The list MUST include `application/json`.

If the account is discoverable via a
[Payment Pointer](./terminology#payment-pointer) the list MUST include
`application/ilp-stream+json`.

An error response uses the applicable HTTP status code value.

The following is a non-normative example response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "https://wallet.example/$/alice",
  "accounts" : [
    {
      "id": "",
      "assetCode": "USD",
      "assetScale" 2,
      "mediaTypes": [
        "application/json", 
        "application/ilp-stream+json" 
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
