import { Mermaid } from './Mermaid'

The following use case demonstrates a 3rd Party Payment Initiation (3PPI) flow. This flow allows a user to authenticate 
a Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP) to make payments on the users behalf without having to hold or be in the flow of money. Example use cases include:
* Authenticating an app for in-app payments
* Authentication existing 3PPI's like Google/Apple Pay.

# Flow

Based on the diagram above the flow is as follows:
1. User provides Payment Pointer
2. PISP gets Open Payments metadata
3. Authenticate PISP
4. Initiate payments

## 1.  User provides Payment Pointer

When a user would like to authenticate a new PISP it will provide them with their Payment Pointer

## 2. PISP gets Open Payments metadata

Using the Payment Pointer provided, the PISP will perform a GET against the correct url.

```http
GET /.well-known/open-payments-server HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.wallet
```

A successful `200` response will return the Open Payments metadata

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "issuer": "https://issuer.wallet",
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://issuer.wallet/authorize",
  "token_endpoint": "https://issuer.wallet/token",
  "token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported": ["client_secret_basic","private_key_jwt"],
  "token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported": ["RS256", "ES256"],
  "userinfo_endpoint": "https://issuer.wallet/userinfo",
  "jwks_uri": "https://issuer.wallet/jwks.json",
  "registration_endpoint": "https://issuer.wallet/register",
  "scopes_supported": ["openid","profile","email","address","phone","offline_access"],
  "response_types_supported": ["code", "token"],
  "service_documentation": "https://issuer.wallet/service_documentation.html",
  "ui_locales_supported": ["en-US", "en-GB", "en-CA", "fr-FR", "fr-CA"],
  "payment_invoices_endpoint": "https://issuer.wallet/invoices",
  "payment_mandates_endpoint": "https://issuer.wallet/mandates",
  "payment_sessions_endpoint": "https://issuer.wallet/sessions",
  "payment_assets_supported": [
    {"code": "USD", "scale": 2},
    {"code": "EUR", "scale": 2}
  ]
}
```

The PISP can now find `payment_mandates_endpoint` with which to create the necessary mandate.

## 3. Authenticate PISP

The PISP creates a mandate on the Users Issuer's wallet using the endpoint above. This mandate will contain the permissions
with which the PISP can operate on the Users behalf.

```http
POST /mandates HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.wallet
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 200,
  "asset" : {
    "code": "USD",
    "scale": 2
  },
  "interval": "P1M",
  "scope": "issuer.wallet/alice"
}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "//issuer.wallet/mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6",
  "amount": 200,
  "asset" : {
    "code": "USD",
    "scale": 2
  },
  "interval": "P1M",
  "start_at": "2020-01-22T00:00:00Z",
  "scope": "issuer.wallet/alice",
  "balance": 200 
}
```

The PISP submits the mandate to the AS of the Issuer in order get authorization from the User. Once the User has 
authorized the mandate, the PISP will receive an access_token with which to use against the mandate.

## 4. Initiate payments

Whenever the PISP wants to initiate a payment on the User behalf, it will submit an invoice to the `/spend` endpoint of 
the mandate it was authorized for. This will instruct the Issuer to complete the payment.

```http
POST /mandates/2fad69d0-7997-4543-8346-69b418c479a6/spend HTTP/1.1
Host: issuer.wallet
Authorization: Bearer random_auth_token
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "invoice": "//acquirer.wallet/invoices/2d24bd87-1afc-465e-a4ec-07cb4f70f7b0"
}

```

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```
